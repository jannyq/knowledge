**Static data members:** When we declare a member of a class as static it means not matter how many objects of the class are created, there is only one copy of the static member.

**Static function:** A static member function can be called even if no objects of the class exist.

**Private constructor:** A private constructor is a special instance constructor. It is generally used in classes that contain static members only. If a class has one or more private constructors and no public constructor, then other classes (except nested classes) can create instances of this class.
